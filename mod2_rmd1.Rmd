Line of text with `R Markdown`

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

* Breakfast
    - Food
          + Eggs
          + Bacon
    - Drinks

> Whane that April
> With the showers soote


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(pressure)
```


## Insert tables!!!

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "top 6 rows of cars dataset")
```


## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x $$

## Insert images!

Here is an image inserted.

## playing foot(note)sie

Trying with a footnote [^1] and then another but long. [^longnote]

And here is an ^[inline note, not sure how this will work] but we'll see if it does.

[^1]. Footnote 1 would go here.
[^longnote]. What is a longnote?
